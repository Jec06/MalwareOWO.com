        <p style="text-align:justify;">   The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful
Stop me and steal my breath
And emeralds from mountains thrust toward the sky
Never revealing their depth
And tell me that we belong together
And dress it up with the trappings of love
I’ll be captivated, I’ll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above
And I’ll be your cryin’ shoulder
I’ll be love’s suicide
And I’ll be better when I’m older
I’ll be the greatest fan of your life
And rain falls angry on the tin roof
As we lie awake in my bed
And you’re my survival, you’re my livin’ proof
My love is alive and not dead
And tell me that we belong together
And dress it up with the trappings of love
I’ll be captivated, I’ll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above
And I’ll be your cryin’ shoulder
I’ll be love’s suicide
And I’ll be better when I’m older
I’ll be the greatest fan of your life
And I dropped out, I burned up
I fought my way back from the dead
Tuned in and turned on
Remembered the thing that you, you said
And I’ll be your cryin’ shoulder
I’ll be love’s suicide
And I’ll be better when I’m older
I’ll be the greatest fan of your
I’ll be your cryin’ shoulder
I’ll be love’s suicide
And I’ll be better when I’m older
I’ll be the greatest fan of your life
The greatest fan of your life
